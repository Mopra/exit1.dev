# What's New - January 2026

Here's what we've been working on this month to make monitoring your websites and services even better.

---

## Status Pages

You can now create **public status pages** to share your service health with customers. Set up a custom domain, choose which checks to display, and give your users real-time visibility into your uptime.

## Bulk Import

Adding multiple checks just got a lot easier. Use our new **bulk import** feature to:
- Paste a list of URLs (one per line)
- Upload a CSV file with full settings support (frequency, HTTP method, headers, validation rules, and more)

Perfect for migrating from another monitoring service or setting up monitoring for a large project.

## SMS Notifications

Stay informed on the go. We now support **SMS alerts** so you can get notified about downtime even when you're away from your inbox.

## Log Notes & Manual Entries

- **Log notes**: Add comments to any check history entry to document what happened or what you did to resolve an issue
- **Manual logs**: Record custom events in your check history for things that happen outside of automated monitoring

## Folder Organization for Everyone

Folders are now available on **all plans**. Organize your checks into logical groups to keep things tidy as you scale.

## Per-Stage Timing Metrics

Check history now includes **detailed timing breakdowns** showing how long each stage of the request took (DNS, connect, TLS, first byte, etc.). Great for debugging slow responses.

## Higher Check Limits

We've increased the maximum checks per account from **100 to 200**. Need more? Reach out and we'll sort you out.

## Monthly Email Budget Limits

In addition to hourly limits, you can now set **monthly email notification budgets** to control alert costs and prevent notification fatigue during extended incidents.
