All UX improvements have been successfully implemented:

### Key Features Added:
- **localStorage persistence** for user preferences (website, date range, status filter, column visibility)
- **Row details Sheet** with full payload, copy buttons, and SSL tooltips
- **Column controls** dropdown to show/hide table columns
- **Debounced search** with highlighting in table cells
- **Skeleton loading states** for better perceived performance
- **Enhanced empty states** with helpful CTAs
- **Status color cues** with left border colors for quick scanning
- **Sticky FilterBar** with glass background
- **Copy-to-clipboard** functionality for URLs, errors, and JSON data
- **Responsive design** with column collapsing on mobile

### Technical Improvements:
- Reusable hooks (`useLocalStorage`, `useDebounce`)
- Modular components (`LogDetailsSheet`, `ColumnControls`, `LogsSkeleton`, `LogsEmptyState`)
- Utility functions for search highlighting and clipboard operations
- DRY principle applied throughout
- TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
